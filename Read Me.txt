Trading Algorithm Project README
Introduction
Welcome to the Trading Algorithm Project! This project aims to provide a customizable trading strategy that you can run using a Fyers account. The strategy is designed to be adaptable to different market sections, not limited to equities.



Requirements
To run this trading strategy, you will need:

Python (version X.X.X or higher)
Fyers account credentials (API key, API secret, username, password)
Fyers API installed (refer to Fyers API documentation for installation instructions)
Required Python packages (list them here, e.g., pandas, requests, etc.)




Setup Instructions
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Customize the trading strategy in the 2nd strategy.py file as per your trading requirements. You can modify indicators, risk management rules, etc.



Important Notes
Ensure that your Fyers account has sufficient funds and permissions to execute trades based on the strategy.
Review and test the strategy thoroughly in a simulated environment before deploying it with real funds.
Monitor the strategy's performance regularly and make adjustments as needed.
For trading in different sections of the market (e.g., derivatives, commodities), modify the strategy logic accordingly.



Disclaimer
Trading involves risk, and past performance does not guarantee future results. The trading strategy provided in this project is for educational purposes only. It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor before trading with real funds.
